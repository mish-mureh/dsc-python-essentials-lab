    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you made it through the new content for the first section of the prework! This cumulative lab will help you review and practice everything you've learned in this section — \"putting it all together\" into an analysis with real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Recall the data types covered so far\n",
    " - Practice extracting information from a nested dataset\n",
    " - Practice generating insights with conditional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task: Analyze Amazon Review Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we are going to be working with data collected by Computer Science researchers at the University of California, San Diego. Their full paper citation is here:\n",

    "#### 2. Review Selection\n",
    "Create a variable `review_index` that can be changed, so that your code will select any review from the collection in order to print out information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Review Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### a. Positive, Negative, or Neutral\n",
    "Print out information describing whether a review's rating is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
